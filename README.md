# Process-Scheduling-Simulation
Interactive Scheduling Simulator with Gantt Chart Visualization

## Overview
This is an interactive CPU scheduling simulator that visualizes various CPU scheduling algorithms. It includes a Gantt chart simulation to help users understand how different scheduling methods affect process execution.

## Features
- Simulates multiple CPU scheduling algorithms:
  - First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
  - Shortest Job First (SJF)
  - Round Robin (RR)
  - Priority Scheduling
- Interactive user interface for real-time simulation.
- Generates Gantt charts for visual representation of process scheduling.

## Installation
To run the simulation locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FadilRahman2004/Process-Scheduling-Simulation.git
   cd Process-Scheduling-Simulation
